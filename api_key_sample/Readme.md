This project show how to use ApiKey for a/all DMSContainer call/calls.
When we use the ApiKey, it's not necessary to make a login call before a/all DMSContainer call/calls.
To configure ApiKey, it's necessary access to DMSAdmin and for every user, generate a ApiKey.
Every time an ApiKey changes, it's necessry to chang it in your code.
